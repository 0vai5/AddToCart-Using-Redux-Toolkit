## Installation
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

```bash
# Clone the repository

## Usage
After successfully installing the dependencies and starting the development server, you can interact with the shopping cart application.

```bash
# To run the development server and access the application in your browser
npm run dev

# To build the application for production deployment
npm run build

# To preview the production-ready build
npm run preview
```
Once `npm run dev` is executed, the application will typically open in your default web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). You can then add items to the cart, adjust quantities, and observe the real-time state updates managed by Redux Toolkit.
